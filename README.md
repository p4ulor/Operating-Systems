# About
- I demonstrate, document & exercise low level operations fundamental to how Operating Systems work
- These matters are important to deeply understand how OSs work
- I use the C language & a Linux distribution as the environment to develop & explore this. I think that it can be easier than installing *MinGW-w64* and then having to configure VSC so everything works good in Windows. But it's also interesting to try it on Windows and see the difference yourself
- As in most of my code, I tend to write the comments in 1 line, normally at the right side of the code to make it more readable. So make sure you have Word Wrap turned off in .c files

# Repo structure
- Just follow the order of the folders to learn
- Inside each folder there's a README.md resuming everything the folder covers w/ C code
