# About
- I demonstrate, document & exercise low level operations fundamental to how Operating Systems work
- These matters are important to deeply understand how OSs work
- I use the C language & a Linux distribution (Ubuntu) as the environment to develop & explore this. I think that it can be easier than installing *MinGW-w64* and then having to configure VSC so everything works good in Windows. But it's also interesting to try it on Windows and see the difference yourself
- The [part 3 of the assignment](./Assigments/tvs-2324-1-leic51n-coursework-g03n1/cw3/) I did in the winter of 2023 also contains some Bash scripts to work with Nginx. This assignment is also the one with my best, most refined & documented work. Although the assignment isn't perfect. 
- As in most of my code, I tend to write the comments in 1 line, normally at the right side of the code to make it more readable. So make sure you have Word Wrap turned off in .c files
- **This repo doesn't cover everything. I didn't have time to finish some stuff**
