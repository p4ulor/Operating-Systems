## Ex1
- The scripts done for ex1 are in [ex1](./ex1/)
- They should be placed and edited in `/opt/isel/tvs/tvsapp/bin` and it's content copied with the file [0_cpy_these_files_to_repo.sh](./ex1/0_cpy_these_files_to_repo.sh) (adapt the path to your relative path)
- The scripts can be given the executable permissions via `chmod +x file.sh` or by going to file properties and then the tab "permissions" through the Ubuntu file explorer

1. The script removes any instances of the upstream tvsapp { } block found in `"/etc/nginx/sites-available/tvsapp"`, and appends the new block with the servers with the indicated starting port and incrementing SCALE times at the end of the file. 
2. The script consults the service with the highest port, and uses it (if found) as the base to start more instances, add those to sites-available
3. The scripts consults the ports and the number of instances of tvsapp that are running, the ones that are found are shutdown until at least 1 remains. If no instances are found, the script exits
4. The scripts consults the ports and the number of instances of tvsapp that are running, the ones that are found are shutdown. If no instances are found, the script exits. The folder link sites-enabled is deleted and nginx is `reloaded`
5. Start elasticsearch if it's not. Start the instances mentioned in sites-available. A folder link is created from `/etc/nginx/sites-available/tvsapp` to `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/tvsapp`, and nginx is `reloaded`
6. The status of nginx, elasticsearch and all the tvsapp services are printed using `systemctl list-units`
