As exceções são interrupções do processador. Sempre que é necessário lidar com as interrupções, é também necessário elevar o nivel de privilégio.

Exemplo de Erro: Um processo tenta aceder a um PTE não permitido (Fora da gama permitida).

Exemplo de não Erro: Page Fault. Um processo tenta aceder a uma página não mapeada, o que causa um page fault exception. No entanto, esta exception
é usada para implementar o paging, pelo que não se trata de um erro.

In the context of x86-64 processors, exceptions are events or conditions that occur during the execution of a program and require special handling. These exceptions are a way for the processor to indicate specific events to the operating system or other privileged software and trigger appropriate actions. Exceptions are closely tied to levels of privilege, as they are used to transition between different privilege levels (rings) within the x86-64 architecture.

x86-64 processors typically have four privilege levels (rings) numbered from 0 to 3, with 0 being the most privileged (kernel mode) and 3 being the least privileged (user mode). Exceptions are categorized based on their sensitivity to privilege levels:

1. **Exception as a Case of Error (e.g., Divide Error Exception):**
   - One example of an exception that corresponds to an error is the "Divide Error Exception." This exception occurs when an attempt is made to divide a value by zero. This is a mathematical error and typically should not occur in well-behaved programs. When this exception happens, the processor transfers control to the exception handler in the operating system's kernel (Ring 0), which can then take appropriate action, such as terminating the offending process or handling the error.

2. **Exception as a Non-Error Situation (e.g., Page Fault Exception):**
   - A situation that is treated as an exception by the processor but may not correspond to an error is the "Page Fault Exception." When a program tries to access a memory page that is not currently in physical memory (a page fault), the processor raises a page fault exception. While this may seem like an error, it's a normal part of virtual memory management. The operating system handles this exception by loading the required page into memory from disk, and then the instruction causing the page fault is re-executed. This mechanism allows the operating system to provide the illusion of having more physical memory than is actually available.

In both cases, the processor transitions from a lower privilege level (user mode) to a higher privilege level (kernel mode) to handle the exception. The operating system has the authority to manage exceptions, and it can take appropriate actions based on the type of exception encountered, whether it's a genuine error or a routine event like a page fault in virtual memory management.
